Our team repo for Nerdery Game Jam 2017!

# Game Concept
The game's themes are focused on Event Horizon, but also could technically qualify for Travel and Humanitarian Aid, and the GIANT MECH's (more on that later) name is Jaguar Beastlord, so... we hit all 4 categories.

The game takes place in space, and the player character is a GIANT MECH flinging packages towards a planet across a field of black holes. The player can either throw one package at a time, to fine-tune their throws, or they can throw several at a time to try to get more packages to the planet within the time limit. The time limit is defined by the planet's survival rate -- each package that reaches the planet increases its survival time.

# Frameworks
We use Unity to create the game, and libraries for the physics, and whatever. We'll fill this section in more once we start gettin' down 'n dirty.
